requests. Pull requests are welcomed! We'd like to review the design and
implementation as early as possible so please submit the pull request
even if it's not 100%. Let us know the purpose of the change and list
the remaining items which need to be addressed before merging. Finally,
PR's should include unit tests and documentation where appropriate.

Important:

This project brings a collection of scripts and small portable programs
that can be useful in a lot of projects. The requirements for any
utility (software or script) to be included in this project are:

    * The utility must be small.
    * The utility setup.cmd script does not need to be called with
      special parameters (this is because of the way the main setup.cmd
      file works).
